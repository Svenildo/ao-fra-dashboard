Hosting Instructions
--------------------

This dashboard is 100% static and can be hosted on:
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel / Netlify
- Any static file server (Nginx, Apache, etc.)

Simply serve the folder `front-end/` as a static website.

Dependencies

No external JavaScript dependencies are required.
The app uses:
- `fetch()` for API requests
- Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
- LocalStorage for theme persistence

API Endpoint
------------

The dashboard expects the following API endpoint:

  https://api.afra.finance/opportunities

This should return a JSON object like:

{
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "last_updated": 1693528382,
    "top_opportunities": { ... },
    "best_global": { ... },
    "table": {
      "BTC": [ ...opportunities... ],
      "ETH": [ ...opportunities... ],
      ...
    }
  }
}

Customization
-------------

To use your own API backend, update this line in `script.js`:

    const res = await fetch("https://api.your.site");

You can replace the URL with your own endpoint (e.g., localhost or hosted API).
